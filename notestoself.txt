- OPTIMISE MESH (CELL COUNT & SIZE DISTRIBUTION)
- EXAMINE CONVERGENCE (assume convergence rate decreases with accuracy for each experiment)

3 points (3 iterations) for each 
- measure gradient, convergence when gradient is small enough
- which setup has fastest convergence?
- say something about convergence rate (what parameter? (what y axis)? and relative to what (what x axis)? increse in number of elements? computation time? discuss in report. computation time is probably the best metric.)
- but know that on other hardware, computation time might scale differently.
-->> plot on BOTH computation time AND element count axes

setups to use
REFERENCE linear shape fn, large cell count, quadratic cell distribution
TESTS: optimising for cell size distribution. keep cell count roughly constant.
- quadratic shape fn, small cell count:
	- logarithmic shape distribution
	- quadratic shape distribution
	- cubic shape distribution
	- something else (literature review?)

- check mesh quality (regular element shape, low aspect ratios, appropriate mesh density, smooth element size transitions, +ve jacobian values, alignment of elements with boundaries
- mesh sensitivity (convergence) analysis

progression in elements:
- 500
- 2 000
- 8 000
- 16 000?
