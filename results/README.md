The folders are autosaved FE solutions from the Jupyter Notebooks (one folder per solution). The names document them in two different ways:

<symmetric or asymmetric plate>_<linear or quadratic shape function>_<element count in mesh>
OR
<symmetric or asymmetric plate>_<linear or quadratic shape function>_<degree with which element size varies with distance from radius>_<element count in mesh>

asymmetric_results excel file and csvs are collated results from the asymmetric plate experiments.
